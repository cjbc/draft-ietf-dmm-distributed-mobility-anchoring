This document defines distributed mobility anchoring in terms of the different
configurations and functions to provide IP mobility support. A network may be
configured with distributed mobility anchoring functions for both network-based
or host-based mobility support according to the needs of mobility support. In
the distributed mobility anchoring environment, multiple anchors are available
for mid-session switching of an IP prefix anchor. To start a new flow or to
handle a flow not requiring IP session continuity as a mobile node moves to a
new network, the flow can be started or re-started using a new IP address
configured from the new IP prefix which is anchored to the new network. The
mobility functions and their operations and parameters are general for different
configurations.

<!-- Introduction -->

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
<t>
A key requirement in distributed mobility management <xref target="RFC7333"/> is
to enable traffic to avoid traversing a single mobility anchor far from an
optimal route. This document defines different configurations, functional
operations and parameters for distributed mobility anchoring and explains how to
use them to make the route changes to avoid unnecessarily long routes.
</t>

<t>
Companion distributed mobility management documents are already addressing the
architecture and deployment <xref target="I-D.ietf-dmm-deployment-models"/>,
source address selection <xref target="I-D.ietf-dmm-ondemand-mobility"/>, and
control-plane data-plane signaling <xref target="I-D.ietf-dmm-fpc-cpdp"/>. A
number of distributed mobility solutions have also been proposed, for example,
in <xref target="I-D.seite-dmm-dma"/>, <xref
target="I-D.bernardos-dmm-pmipv6-dlif"/>, <xref
target="I-D.sarikaya-dmm-for-wifi"/>, <xref
target="I-D.yhkim-dmm-enhanced-anchoring"/>, and <xref
target="I-D.matsushima-stateless-uplane-vepc"/>.
</t>


<t>
Distributed mobility anchoring employs multiple anchors in the data plane. In
general, control plane functions may be separated from data plane functions and
be centralized but may also be co-located with the data plane functions at the
distributed anchors. Different configurations of distributed mobility anchoring
are described in <xref target="sec:distributed-anchoring-configurations"/>.
</t>

<t>
As an MN attaches to an access router and establishes a link between them, a /64
IPv6 prefix anchored to the router may be assigned to the link for exclusive use
by the MN <xref target="RFC6459"/>. The MN may then configure a global IPv6
address from this prefix and use it as the source IP address in a flow to
communicate with its correspondent node (CN). When there are multiple mobility
anchors, an address selection for a given flow is first required before the flow
is initiated. Using an anchor in an MN's network of attachment has the advantage
that the packets can simply be forwarded according to the forwarding table.
However, after the flow has been initiated, the MN may later move to another
network, so that the IP address no longer belongs to the current network of
attachment of the MN.
</t>

<t>
The IP session continuity needs of a flow (application) determines the how the
IP address used by the traffic of this flow has to be anchored. If the ongoing
IP flow can cope with an IP prefix/address change, the flow can be reinitiated
with a new IP address anchored in the new network. On the other hand, if the
ongoing IP flow cannot cope with such change, mobility support is needed. A
network supporting a mix of flows both requiring and not requiring IP mobility
support will need to distinguish these flows.

<!-- Conventions and terminoloty (begin section)-->
<section anchor="sec:definitions"
title="Conventions and Terminology">

<t>
All general mobility-related terms and their acronyms used in this document 
are to be interpreted as defined in the Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) 
base specification <xref target="RFC6275"/>, 
the Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) specification <xref target="RFC5213"/>,
the "Mobility Related Terminologies" <xref target="RFC3753"/>,
and the DMM current practices and gap analysis <xref target="RFC7429"/>.
These include terms such as mobile node (MN), correspondent node (CN), 
home agent (HA), home address (HoA), care-of-address (CoA), 
local mobility anchor (LMA), and mobile access gateway (MAG).
</t>

<t>In addition, this document uses the following terms:</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
<t hangText="Home network of an application session or a home address:">
the network that has assigned the HoA 
used as the session identifier by the application running in an MN. 
The MN may be running multiple application sessions, 
and each of these sessions can have a different home network. 
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
</t>

<t hangText="Anchoring (an IP prefix/address):">
An IP prefix, i.e., Home Network Prefix (HNP), 
or address, i.e., HoA,
assigned for use by an MN is topologically anchored to an anchor node 
when the anchor node is able to advertise a connected route 
into the routing infrastructure for the assigned IP prefix. 
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
</t>

<t hangText="Location Management (LM) function:">
that keeps and manages the network location information of an MN.
The location information may be a binding 
of the advertised IP address/prefix, e.g., HoA or HNP, 
to the IP routing address of the MN or of a node 
that can forward packets destined to the MN. 
<vspace blankLines="1"/> 

When the MN is a mobile router (MR)
carrying a mobile network of mobile network nodes (MNN),
the location information will also include 
the mobile network prefix (MNP),
which is the aggregate IP prefix
delegated to the MR
to assign IP prefixes for use by the MNNs in the mobile network.
<vspace blankLines="1"/> 
 
In a client-server protocol model, 
location query and update messages may be exchanged
between a Location Management client (LMc) 
and a Location Management server (LMs), 
where
the location information can be updated to or queried from the LMs.

Optionally, there may be a Location Management proxy (LMp)
between LMc and LMs.
<vspace blankLines="1"/> 

With separation of control plane and data plane, 
the LM function is in the control plane. 
It may be a logical function at the control plane node, 
control plane anchor, or mobility controller. 
<vspace blankLines="1"/> 

It may be distributed or centralized. 
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
</t>

<t hangText="Forwarding Management (FM) function:">
packet interception and forwarding to/from the IP address/prefix 
assigned for use by the MN, based on the internetwork location information, 
either to the destination or to some other network element 
that knows how to forward the packets to their destination. 
<vspace blankLines="1"/>

This function may be used to achieve traffic indirection. 
With separation of control plane and data plane, 
the FM function may split into a FM function in the data plane (FM-DP) 
and a FM function in the control plane (FM-CP).
<vspace blankLines="1"/> 

FM-DP may be distributed with distributed mobility management. 
It may be a function in a data plane anchor or data plane node. 
<vspace blankLines="1"/> 

FM-CP may be distributed or centralized. 
It may be a function in a control plane node,
control plane anchor or mobility controller. 
<vspace blankLines="1"/>

distributed mobility management.
</t>

<t>
The main characteristics of a network-based DMM solution are:
</t>

<t>

<list style="bullets">

<t>
There are multiple data plane anchors (i.e., DPA instances), each with an FM-DP
function.
</t>

<t>
The control plane may either be distributed (not shown in the figure) or
centralized (as shown in the figure).
</t>

<t>
The control plane and the data plane (Control Plane Anchor -- CPA -- and Data
Plane Anchor -- DPA) may be co-located or not. If the CPA is co-located with the
distributed DPAs, then there are multiple co-located CPA-DPA instances (not
shown in the figure).
</t>

<t>
An IP prefix/address IP1 (anchored to the DPA with IP address IPa1) is assigned
for use by an MN. The MN uses this IP1 address to communicate with CNs (not
shown in the figure).
</t>

<t>
The location management (LM) function may be co-located or split (as shown in
the figure) into a separate server (LMs) and a client (LMc). In this case, the
LMs may be centralized whereas the LMc may be distributed or centralized,
according to whether the CPA is distributed or centralized.

<section anchor="sec:on-demand"
 title="IP Mobility Handling in Distributed Anchoring Environments
- Mobility Support Only When Needed">

<t>
IP mobility support may be provided only when needed instead of being provided
by default.
</t>

<t>
A straightforward choice of mobility anchoring is for a flow to use the IP
prefix of the network to which the MN is attached when the flow is initiated
<xref target="I-D.seite-dmm-dma"/> <xref
target="I-D.bernardos-dmm-pmipv6-dlif"/>. 
</t>

<t>
The IP prefix/address at the MN's side of a flow may be anchored at the access
router to which the MN is attached. For example, when an MN attaches to a
network (Net1) or moves to a new network (Net2), an IP prefix from the attached
network is assigned to the MN's interface. In addition to configuring new
link-local addresses, the MN configures from this prefix an IP address which is
typically a dynamic IP address. It then uses this IP address when a flow is
initiated. Packets to the MN in this flow are simply forwarded according to the
forwarding table.
</t>

<t>
There may be multiple IP prefixes/addresses that an MN can select when
initiating a flow. They may be from the same access network or different access
networks. The network may advertise these prefixes with cost options <xref
target="I-D.mccann-dmm-prefixcost"/> so that the mobile node may choose the one
with the least cost. In addition, these IP prefixes/addresses may be of
different types regarding whether mobility support is needed <xref
target="I-D.ietf-dmm-ondemand-mobility"/>. A flow will need to choose the
appropriate one according to whether it needs IP mobility support.
</t>


<!-- Changing to the new IP prefix/address (begin section) -->
<section anchor="sec:changing-anchor"
 title="No Need of IP Mobility: Changing to New IP Prefix/Address">

<t>
When IP mobility support is not needed for a flow, the LM and FM functions are
not utilized so that the configurations in <xref
target="sec:distributed-anchoring-configurations"/> are simplified as shown in
<xref target="fig:change-net" />.

</figure>

<t>
When there is no need to provide IP mobility to a flow, the flow may use a new
IP address acquired from a new network as the MN moves to the new network.
</t>

<t>
Regardless of whether IP mobility is needed, if the flow has terminated before
the MN moves to a new network, the flow may subsequently restart using the new
IP address assigned from the new network.
</t>

<t>
When IP session continuity is needed, even if a flow is ongoing as the MN moves,
it may still be desirable for the flow to change to using the new IP prefix
configured in the new network. The flow may then close and then restart using a
new IP address configured in the new network. Such a change in the IP address of
the flow may be enabled using a higher layer mobility support which is not in
the scope of this document.
</t>

<t>
In <xref target="fig:change-net" />, a flow initiated while the MN was using the
IP prefix IP1 anchored to a previous access router AR1 in network Net1 has
terminated before the MN moves to a new network Net2. After moving to Net2, the
MN uses the new IP prefix IP2 anchored to a new access router AR2 in network
Net2 to start a new flow. The packets may then be forwarded without requiring IP
layer mobility support.

<section anchor="sec:needed" title="Need of IP Mobility">

<t>
When IP mobility is needed for a flow, the LM and FM functions in <xref
target="sec:distributed-anchoring-configurations"/> are utilized. The mobility
support may be provided by IP prefix anchor switching to the new network to be
described in <xref target="sec:switching-anchor"/> or by using other mobility
management methods (<xref target="Paper-Distributed.Mobility"/>, <xref
target="Paper-Distributed.Mobility.PMIP"/> and <xref
target="Paper-Distributed.Mobility.Review"/>). Then the flow may continue to use
the IP prefix from the prior network of attachment. Yet some time later, the
user application for the flow may be closed. If the application is started
again, the new flow may not need to use the prior network's IP address to avoid
having to invoke IP mobility support. This may be the case where a dynamic IP
prefix/address rather than a permanent one is used. The flow may then use the
new IP prefix in the network where the flow is being initiated. Routing is again
kept simpler without employing IP mobility and will remain so as long as the MN
which is now in the new network has not moved again and left to another new
network.
</t>

<t>
An example call flow in this case is outlined in <xref
target="fig:flow-continuity" />.

Multiple instances of DPAs (at access routers), which are providing IP prefix to
the MNs, are needed to provide distributed mobility anchoring in an appropriate
configuration such as those described in <xref target="fig:dmm_net-based" />
(<xref target="sec:distributed-anchoring-network-based" />) for network-based
distributed mobility or in <xref target="fig:dmm_client-based" /> (<xref

- Anchor Switching to the New Network">


<t>
IP mobility is invoked to enable IP session continuity for an ongoing flow as
the MN moves to a new network. Here the anchoring of the IP address of the flow
is in the home network of the flow, which is not in the current network of
attachment. A centralized mobility management mechanism may employ indirection
from the anchor in the home network to the current network of attachment. Yet it
may be difficult to avoid unnecessarily long route when the route between the MN
and the CN via the anchor in the home network is significantly longer than the
direct route between them. An alternative is to switch the IP prefix/address
anchoring to the new network.

<t>
As an MN with an ongoing session moves to a new network, the flow may preserve
IP session continuity by moving the anchoring of the original IP prefix/address
of the flow to the new network. 
</t>

<t>
One way to accomplish such move is to use a centralized routing protocol, but
note that this solution presents some scalability concerns and its applicability
is typically limited to small networks.
